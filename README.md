# UIDAI Decision Intelligence System (UDIS) - 2026 Edition

## Executive Overview
The **UIDAI Decision Intelligence System (UDIS)** is an advanced, administrative-grade platform designed to bridge the gap between massive datasets and effective regional governance. Developed for the **UIDAI Data Hackathon 2026**, UDIS shifts the paradigm from simple dashboards to **Advisory Governance Support**.

## Core Innovation Pillars

### 1. Composite Risk Score (CRS)
UDIS abandons univariate thresholds in favor of a **Multivariate Composite Index**. The CRS is a transparent, explainable metric (0.0 - 1.0) calculated as:
$$CRS = 0.35P_{endency} + 0.25D_{elay} + 0.25C_{apacity} + 0.15V_{olatility}$$
This provides a unified view of regional friction that identifies systemic failures before they manifest as citizen complaints.

### 2. Governance Reframing: Cost of Inaction (COI)
A unique evaluation pillar of UDIS is the **Cost of Inaction** logic. Instead of just reporting "current" status, the system simulates the trajectory of unresolved friction over 14 and 30-day windows. This reframes data as a call to action for administrators.

### 3. Explainable Rule Trace (ERT)
To meet the transparency standards of government audits (and RTI disclosures), every decision signal generated by UDIS includes an **Explainable Rule Trace**. We avoid "Black Box ML," providing clear, auditable logic for why a specific regional alert was triggered.

### 4. Predictive Resource Planning
UDIS includes a **Seasonal Load Forecast (ARIMA-Lite)**. By predicting enrollment and update volumes for the coming quarter, UIDAI administrators can pre-emptively shift mobile kits to anticipated high-friction clusters.

## Security & Compliance (Hackathon 2026 Standard)
- **PII Integrity**: Zero storage of actual Aadhaar numbers. All identifiers are masked (XXXX-XXXX-1234).
- **ALIS Firewall**: Uses the Aadhaar Lifecycle Intelligence Sandbox protocol to ensure PII is decoupled from decision logs.
- **Decision Support**: Explicitly designed as a *Human-in-the-Loop* system. UDIS advises; humans authorize.

## Technical Stack
- **Engine**: TypeScript 5.0 (Deterministic Index Calculations)
- **Intelligence**: Gemini-3-Flash (Policy Synthesis & COI Modeling)
- **Visualization**: Recharts & CSS Grid (Regional Multivariate Analysis)
- **Deployment**: Compliant with National Informatics Centre (NIC) architectural patterns.
